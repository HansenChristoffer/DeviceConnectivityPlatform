# DeviceConnectivityPlatform

The **DeviceConnectivityPlatform** is a personal project created for home automation purposes. It serves as a comprehensive backend solution for managing various smart devices and appliances within your home. The project is currently being developed during free time outside of work commitments.

## Features

The platform aims to provide reliable and redundant communication capabilities for managing smart devices through different means. TCP communication is in the works, and SMS support is planned for the future.

One of the main goals of the project is to be highly modular and scalable, enabling you to run different nodes of the backend on different hosts. This will provide benefits such as improved scalability, redundancy, uptime, and resource usage.

## Planned IoT Devices

As the project progresses, I plan to create a variety of IoT devices that will be compatible with this backend system. These devices include:

- **Logical Device:** The main component of the home automation system, which serves as the logical unit and handles the communication and coordination between the other devices.
- **Climate Device:** A device that uses various sensors to keep track of climate data.
- **Camera Device:** A device that allows for taking pictures and streaming video.
- **Voice Device:** A device that can project sound files and actual sound over VoIP.
- **Interface Device:** A device with an interface, such as a touch screen, that displays data and enables the user to enable/disable various configurations.

Note that these are only ideas at this stage, and nothing has been planned or designed yet.

## Getting Started
